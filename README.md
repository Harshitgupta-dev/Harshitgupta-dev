I'm Harshit Gupta, a spirited +1 student from India. Having secured 91.4% in my Class 10 exams, I'm driven by a commitment to academic excellence. Currently delving into web development, particularly adept at HTML and CSS, I'm nurturing the dream of becoming a skilled programmer. Outside the academic realm, my free time is dedicated to learning and exploring new technologies.

An extrovert by nature, I'm recognized for my friendly demeanor. I take pride in my ability to uphold promises and readily admit when I'm wrong. In group settings, I don't shy away from pointing out wrong practices, believing in the importance of ethical conduct. While I don't adhere to a specific life philosophy at the moment, my journey is characterized by an unwavering dedication to personal growth and a thirst for knowledge.
